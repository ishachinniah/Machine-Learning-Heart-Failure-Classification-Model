## Machine-Learning-Heart-Failure-Classification-Model

This project aims to use machine learning models to accurately predict patient outcomes with regards to heart diseases using clinical and demographic data; the success criteria for this project was to achieve an accuracy rate of around 80% in identifying high-risk patients who need intense care due to heart failure. Additionally, feature selection was performed to prevent overfitting the models by identifying significant features in predicting patient outcomes. Finally, a wide range of classification models were employed and compared to identify ones with the highest accuracy in predicting patient outcomes using the selected features from the dataset. 

The application area of this project is in the medical field â€“ specifically in the diagnosis of heart diseases. Accurately diagnosing heart diseases can aid in early intervention and the use of appropriate treatments. This project has the potential to improve patient outcomes by identifying high-risk patients early on and providing them with appropriate care. The use of machine learning in this project can work towards analyzing vast amounts of data, identifying complex patterns in the data, and make predictions within the health sector. The models would ultimately take steps towards personalized medical assistance for individuals by using their clinical and demographic data for prognosis and medical intervention.
